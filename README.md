# Discord Bot for Minecraft Server

## About
This is a Python-based Discord bot created for a Minecraft server, designed to provide user-specific location calculations and save location data. It connects to a local database and runs on a server from a personal PC. This bot was my first attempt at creating any kind of chatbot, learning everything needed from scratch.
